What you need to use this script
--------------------------------
In order to use this script you must have an addon installed called Ovale. [Ovale Spell Priority](http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/ovale/) shows you what spell or ability you should use in order to maximize your damage.

It displays one or more icons that show the cooldown of an action. The action is conditionally defined through a user defined script. E.g. you may display either Corruption if the DOT is not on your target or Shadowbolt if the DOT is already on your target.

Everything is configurable with a user-editable script.

Default scripts are available for all dps and tank classes and specs, based on [Simulationcraft](http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/) scripts.

The user may customize the default script to suit his needs (see [Documentation](http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/ovale/pages/documentation/)). Scripts may be shared between users.
